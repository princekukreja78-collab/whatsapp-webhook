In India, transfer of vehicle ownership must be completed within 14 days if the vehicle is sold within the same state, and within 45 days if sold to another state. Form 29 and Form 30 are mandatory. If hypothecation exists, Form 35 and bank NOC are required. RC transfer is the legal proof of ownership and liability remains with the seller until transfer is completed.
